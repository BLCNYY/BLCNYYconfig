- 👋 Hi, I’m @OmerBalkan100101, with real name, Ömer Balkan.
- 👀 I’m currently doing some UI design and making videos for my YouTube channel.
- 🌱 I am currently studying at a secondary school in Istanbul, Turkey and will start studying at a high school in September 2022. I want to study software engineering at university. 
- 💞️ One of my biggest dreams is learning pro-grade coding and developing a software that everyone in the world will use and help people do somethings easier.
